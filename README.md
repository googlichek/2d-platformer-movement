### 2d movement controller prototype.

This project was created to showcase 2d player controller with movement and jump that feel good.

### Controls:

`A` - Left

`D` - Right

`W` and `S` - Crouch

`Space` - Jump

`K` and `LMouse` - Shoot / Punch

### Details:

This is a prototype to showcase movemment mechanics, but I added some barebone combat abilities too.
Currently player can shoot only while standing still since I felt like I don't have enough sprites to implement shooting while player is running.
If the player is running then pressing attack button will result in a punch action.

There are also some enemies that can be used as punching bags, but in their current state they don't react to player's actions much.
